In this path are some pngs with GUI design. In GUI it is needed to have:
- main menu,
- lightning/ heating settings menu,
- room choose menu,
- add new room menu (only name setting),
- add new device menu (setting name, controlling signal type, unit type, limits (min and max value), pins where connected the device is)
