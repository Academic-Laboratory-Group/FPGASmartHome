# PINOUT for digital temperature sensor DS18B20
          NUCLEO PIN                SENSOR PIN
             PC8  ------------------->  DQ
             +5V  ------------------->  VDD
             GND  ------------------->  GND
To correct work temperature sensor should be connected also resistor pull up between pin +5V and GND.

Scheamtic to correct connection:
